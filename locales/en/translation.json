This platform allows citizens to select and rank more than 100 alternatives taken from the government programs of the main candidates for the 2022 presidential election.</p>  <p style=\"color:#0C7BDC;\"><b>Collective Intelligence</b></p><p> brazucracia.org is a simple collaborative exercise that allows users to not only build their own government programs, but also identify areas of agreement and disagreement with other participants. The platform presents users with alternatives extracted from the candidates' government programs. It asks them to select the alternatives they agree with, and then to rank these agreed upon alternatives in order of preference. Each participation, even partial, is taken into account in the creation of the collective program and in identifying the divisive alternatives.</p>   <p style=\"color:#0C7BDC;\"> <b>Our goal</b></p><p> The team's goal is not to influence the 2022 election, but to obtain new knowledge about online participation systems and to better know the empirical limits of social choice theory.</p>  <p style=\"color:#0C7BDC;\"><b> Why we don't recommend which candidate to vote for</b></p><p> The implementation of a voter recommendation system is based on a number of assumptions specific to the election in question and can easily result in biases for or against certain candidates. It is difficult to  guarantee that the recommendations provided to the user are impartial. In our research labs, we take the issue of algorithmic bias very seriously, and one of the goals of the brazucracia platform is to generate data that can help us think about how to build better recommender systems. </p>   <p style=\"color:#0C7BDC;\"><b>About us </b> </p><p>The platform was built by a team from the Center for Collective Learning, the flagship interdisciplinary research laboratory of the 3IA Institute of the University of Toulouse (ANITI). The team is led by Cesar A. Hidalgo, a Chilean-American researcher who moved to France in 2020, after leading a research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 2010 to 2019. The platform has was built by Carlos Navarrete, a doctoral candidate under the direction of CÃ©sar Hidalgo, in collaboration with lawyers, computer scientists and mathematicians, including experts in social choice theory from the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT), the CNRS, the Paris 3IA PRAIRIE institute and the Paris-Dauphine University. Hidalgo and Navarrete have previously worked together on similar platforms, including Chilecracia, a digital participation platform that garnered over 7 million citizen preferences during the 2019 Chilean revolution.</p>  <p>For any question please contact: hello@centerforcollectivelearning.org</p>","relatedworks-title":"Related works","relatedworks-summary":"<p><a href=\"https://chilecracia.org/resultados\">Chilecracia</a></p><p><a href=\"https://lebanocracia.org/results\">Lebanocracia</a></p>"},"bar":{"wins":"Wins","losses":"Losses","ties":"Ties","win-rate":"Win Rate"},"game":{"copy":"Copy results","next-proposal":"Next alternative","enter":"Enter","show-answers":"Display answers","hide-answers":"Hide answers","getting-started":"<h3>HOW TO PLAY</h3>  <p>Guess which candidates support this alternative.
